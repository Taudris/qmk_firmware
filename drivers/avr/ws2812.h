 * Input:
 *         ledarray:           An array of GRB data describing the LED colors
 *         number_of_leds:     The number of LEDs to write
 *         pinmask (optional): Bitmask describing the output bin. e.g. _BV(PB0)
 *
 * The functions will perform the following actions:
 *         - Set the data-out pin as output
 *         - Send out the LED data
 *         - Wait 50µs to reset the LEDs

 * Old interface / Internal functions
 *
 * The functions take a byte-array and send to the data output as WS2812 bitstream.
 * The length is the number of bytes to send. Normally 3 per LED, but 4 for RGBW.
